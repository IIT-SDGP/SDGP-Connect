## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions through:

- **Issues**: Report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements using GitHub Issues.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Fork the repo, make changes in your own branch, and submit a PR to the `main` branch.

> Note: You will not have direct push access to the `main` branch. All changes must go through pull requests.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a **feature branch** from `main`.
3. Make your changes.
4. **Commit** your changes with a proper message (see below).
5. **Push** your changes to your fork.
6. Open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch.

We review and approve PRs regularly. If you need help or want to discuss before submitting, feel free to [contact us](https://wa.me/94766867362?text=Hi%2C%20I'm%20need%20some%20help%20with%20SDGP.lk%20Contribution).

## Commit Message Guidelines

Effective Git commit messages and PR titles greatly help in understanding changes and maintaining code quality.

### Best Practices:

- Limit the subject line to **50 characters**.
- **Capitalize** the subject line.
- **Do not** end the subject line with a period.
- Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line.

### Good Examples:

- `Fix the failure to generate records from XML when multiple namespaces exist`
- `Fix GraalVM compatibility warnings after Java17 migration`

## Testing

If your PR includes significant changes, please ensure:

- The application builds without errors.
- Existing features remain unaffected.
- Any new features are tested manually or with appropriate scripts.

---

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for basic linting and build checks. Make sure your code passes CI before requesting a review.
