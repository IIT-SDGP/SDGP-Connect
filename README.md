## What is SDGP Connect?

**[sdgp.lk](https://sdgp.lk)** is a platform built for the **Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT)** as part of the SDGP (Software Development Group Project) module. Its core mission is to **showcase student-led tech projects** and **connect them with real-world investors, mentors, and industry partners**.

This platform acts as a digital bridge between innovation and opportunity—allowing students to go beyond academic recognition and **attract funding, incubation, or partnerships** that help bring their projects to life.

> SDGP Connect was collaboratively designed and developed by a team of contributors in partnership with IIT.
